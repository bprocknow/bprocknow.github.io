                    <p>A heliostat is a part of a renewable energy source called a Concentrated Solar Power System (CSP).  This system works by reflecting light off mirrors from the sun to a central location called a power tower.  The energy can be used to turn water into steam and run through a turbine to generate electricity on demand.
                      <br><br>
                    The heliostat is the device that redirects the sunlight to the power tower.  It is usually driven by a pair of motors that rotate the mirror along two axises.  There can be thousands of heliostats in a single CSP system.  The heliostats usually account for around 50% of the total cost of the CSP system.  Our goal was to redesign the heliostat in order to reduce its overall cost while keeping its efficiency high.</p>

                        Our heliostat design is different from a traditional design, in that it couples multiple rotated heliostat mirrors together using the same two motors to control all of the mirrors (See figure on right).  This design required that for every rotated mirror, there needed to be one extra stationary mirror due to reflection geometry.  The idea was that the cost of mirrors are a lot less than the cost of motors, so despite doubling the number of mirrors needed, the total cost per area of reflected light would go down.

                        The first of the two semesters of the project, my largest subproject was to create a 3D simulation of our heliostat system in order to optimize different parts of our heliostat design.
                        <br><br>
                        Here is an example of an optimization that increased system efficiencies:
                        <br>  A ray tracing method was created that used our teams sun tracking code to perform live simulations of the sun at any location.  Each sun ray vector was found to either hit or miss the stationary mirror.  All of the rays that hit the stationary mirror would hit the power tower target.  This data found that our stationary mirror was initially undersized by around 4.2% which lead to between 5-12% of sunlight not being reflected by the stationary mirror.
                        <br><br>  The visualization video on the right shows our heliostat system on the right, with the stationary mirrors on the far right of the screen, then the rotated mirrors in the middle, and the power tower where the energy from the sun is stored on the left.

                  <p>
                    My role was a System Technician Intern, where half of my work was spent in the office doing Engineering
                    work, and half on a construction job site where I commissioned and serviced HVAC (Heating, air conditioning and ventilation) systems.
                    <br><br>
                    For the engineering work, I created Mechanical drawings in Visio, created parts lists from construction plans from
                    the building architect, programmed software for HVAC systems using state based logic and created databases for
                    new or existing HVAC systems, where each component in the system is a entity in the database which can
                    be used by the customer through a UI.
                    <br><br>
                    On the service side, I would do point-to-point checks on numerous different HVAC systems to verify that the
                    each component of the system worked.  Depending on the system, I would run through a sequence of commands that
                    verified the system functioned correctly and the software put the system into the correct state depending on the
                    inputs.

                    During all four summers through Highschool I did landscaping full time.  During the last two years
                    I was trusted with managing a team of three people where we did pruning, cleaning, plantings and
                    other landscaping maintainance for commercial and residential sites.
